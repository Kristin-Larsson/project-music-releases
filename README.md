# Music Releases
This week we will practice React and creating components by using data from Spotify. You will build a page which shows new album and single releases. This project should be done pair programming, find your pairings here.

Requirements 
**What you need to do**

✓ Your app should have components

✓ Your page should look as close as possible to the design provided.

✓ You should display the following for each album:

- album cover image
- album name
- the name of each artist involved with a comma between

✓ Hover effects:

- When you hover over an album, it should go darker, and you should show a play button, a favourite button, and the ellipsis (see the design sketch)
- When you hover over the play button, it should grow (see the design sketch)
- Hovering an artist name or an album name should match the design sketch

✓ When you click on the album, it should link to the album's external url in the data

✓ When you click on an artist, it should link to the artist's external url in the data

✓ Your page should be responsive:

- showing 4 albums per row on desktop
- 2 per row on tablet
- 1 per row on mobile.


## The problem

We have worked in pairs with live share & branches. We started by planning & making a drawing in Figjam. We did part of the codes together & part of it separate. We used google, Stackoverflow & asked our team for help when we got stuck. If we had more time we would have worked with accessibility.
