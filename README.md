# Music Releases
Music site built in React using data from Spotify. Used grid and hover effect in CSS.

## The problem

We have worked in pairs with live share & branches. We started by planning & making a drawing in Figjam. We did part of the codes together & part of it separate. We used google, Stackoverflow & asked our team for help when we got stuck. If we had more time we would have worked with accessibility.
